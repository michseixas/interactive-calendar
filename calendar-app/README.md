	1.	An interactive Calendar where...

	•	Users can add, delete, and edit events.
	•	Events can have custom colors and images/icons.

	2.	Real-Time Collaboration:
	•	Multiple users can edit the same calendar.

	3.	Visual Customization:
	•	Add stickers/icons like airplanes, party hats, or custom images.

	4.	Simplicity:
	•	Easy-to-use interface.

Tech Stack

	1.	Frontend: React.js (for interactive UI)
	2.	Backend: Firebase Firestore (for real-time updates) or Node.js with a database like MongoDB.
	3.	State Management: Context API or Redux (optional)
	4.	Styling: CSS Modules or TailwindCSS for simplicity and visual appeal.
	5.	File/Image Handling: Firebase Storage or an equivalent service for icons/stickers.

Design the Calendar Component:
Use react-calendar for the basic structure, then customize it.

Add Real-Time Functionality:
Use Firebase Firestore to sync calendar events across users in real-time.

Handle Customization:
Allow users to:
	•	Add/edit/delete events.
	•	Add custom colors and stickers/icons (e.g., upload images).

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
